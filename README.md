### Hey, there 👋

I found out this! You make a profile readme by making a repo under your using name and ading md. How cool is that?

I am a web developer based in Ladysmith, Vancouver Island, Canada (About 2-3 hours from Vancouver via Ferry).  
Currently I am focused on learning React/Gatsby, Redux and GraphQL. I also have done some Ruby on Rails, WordPress (sage) and basic html/css sites. 

I am non-ironically obsessed with ponies 🐴 . unicorns 🦄  and purple. I also ride horses and ponies in real life.
