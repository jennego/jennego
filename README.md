### Hey, there 👋


I found out this! You make a profile readme by making a repo under your using name and ading md. How cool is that?
**jennego/jennego** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am a web devoloper based in Ladysmith, Vancouver Island, Canada (About 2-3 hours from Vancouver via Ferry). I am a junior devoloper so I am still learning. Currently I am focused on learning React/Gatsby, Redux and GraphQL. I also have done some Ruby on Rails, WordPress (sage) and basic html/css sites. 

Apparently, I look the same working in quarantine or not lol. 

I am non-ironically obsessed with ponies🐴 . unicorns🦄  and purple. I also ride horses and ponies in real life.
