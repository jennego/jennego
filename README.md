### Hey, there 👋

I am looking for a remote job! Front-end, some full stack okay too. Part-time or contract is fine! Internship is fine (as long as there's actually mentorship). Not looking for a full time role. Thanks.

I found out this! You make a profile readme by making a repo under your using name and ading md. How cool is that?

Currently I am focused on learning React/Gatsby, Redux and GraphQL. I also have done some Ruby on Rails, WordPress (sage), Django (as api source) and basic html/css sites.

I am non-ironically obsessed with ponies 🐴 . unicorns 🦄   and purple. I attempt to ride dressage (I do spend a bit of time away from the screen! Not much, but some.
