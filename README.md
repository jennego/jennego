### Hey (or is it HAY), there 👋

I am looking for a remote job! Front-end, some full stack okay too. Part-time or contract is fine! Internship is fine (as long as there's actually mentorship).

Looking for a job for Fall 2022 and on! Remote only, flexible on everything else. 

I'm Jennifer or Jen. I am a web developer based in Ladysmith, Vancouver Island, Canada (About 2-3 hours from Vancouver via Ferry).  
Currently I am focused on learning React/Gatsby, Redux and GraphQL. Most of my personal projects are currently with a JAMstack, usually with Gatsby. I also have done some Ruby on Rails, WordPress (sage), Django (as api source) and basic html/css sites.

I am non-ironically obsessed with ponies 🐴 . unicorns 🦄   and purple. I attempt to ride dressage (I do spend a bit of time away from the screen! Not much, but some.)

- 🎓   2017 Graduate of CodeCore Bootcamp. Also 2013 SFU BA (English)
- Frontend (React, templating etc) and JAMstack, with some backend skills (APIs, MVC like Rails)
- 💜 Often Not But Always Purple
- 🙃 Weirdo 
- 🐴 Horse and Pony Obsessed 
- 🇨🇦 Canadian (BC - Pacific Time)

Currently working on learning: Elixir, Phoenix, GraphQL, more React
